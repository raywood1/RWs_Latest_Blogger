<div class="post-body">
<p>This is a list of extensions that served me well in Firefox 3.  At this writing, I was just in the process of switching to Firefox 4, having allowed a bit of time for the worst of the early incompatibilities and bugs to sort themselves out.  I was not sure how many of these FF 3 extensions would persevere in FF 4.  But this was, anyway, my starting list of important extensions to try to perpetuate.<br/>
<br/>
A fast way to view these extensions, incidentally, would be to install something like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190906051610/https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/snap-links/">Snap Links</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190906051610/https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-links/">Multi Links</a> extensions, drag a right-click boundary around the following links, and allow them all to open in separate tabs.<br/>

### Comments
**raywood**:
Correction.  In Firefox 3, I had been having some problems with TabGroups Manager for some time.  It was overly optimistic to leave it in this list.  I loved the concept, and it had worked well originally, but not recently.  That item might belong on this list for an upgrade to FF 4, but I wasn't there yet.
