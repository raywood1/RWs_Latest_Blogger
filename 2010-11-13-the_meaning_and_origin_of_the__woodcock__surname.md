I'm a woodcock from Bolton England and my family tree goes back first to tyldesley Lancashire 1900 then pipe gate Shropshire 1850 .. The family seemed to be in the mining industry during the industrial revolution .. Thank you for your information .David Thomas Woodcock

I was born in New Zealand and my Woodcock family tree goes back to William Mark Woodcock of Bristol, UK, who was a brushmaker.  I would like to know whether he made artist brushes of the woodcock pinion feathers and whether his surname was derived from that occupation of hunting woodcocks in order to make those woodcock feather artist brushes. It is speculation on my part for the time being.  I am also interested in the idea or possibility that my Woodcock ancestors may have been Jewish. My understanding is that most Jews are blood group B.  I am blood group B and so was my late father.I am curious to know whether other Woodcock families have blood group B.Thank you for your information so far.Catherine F. Woodcock

Hi Im Simon Woodcock  born and raised in Stoke-on-Trent England father was Barry Woodcock son of my Grandfather, William Woodcock who came here from Halifax, Yorkshire thats as much as I have so far about my past, my grandad died before I got to meet him. My blood group is O+, blue eyes and dark brown wavy hair. Anyway this is looking a lot like a cheap ad right now so moving on. Im really interested in this subject and was glad to find alll the valid facts in one place and very well referenced by the way mate Iv bookmarked this archive you've created. Theres a huge part of me at the moment wanting it to have come from a type of hunting because I can just really see it, apparently it was used in France before here in England. I can imagine a lot of woodland in france hundreds of years ago and the Eurasion Woodcock bird is still found all over Europe. This also would explain to me where some of the ''stupity'' references were formed, if this theory is correct then the original Woodcocks were most likely to have lived near, or, in woodland. The people of the towns or even villages back then would have had no concept of the difficulty of catching these illusive birds and, like we townies today, would have looked at a pair of this birds hanging in the villages and said ''chicken''. I only speculate of course but there is more truth in the "Wood" in Woodcock an ancient word that has changed spelling and sound, at times slightly, but I'll wager that our word for wood will be much older in our languages than cottage or cook.
