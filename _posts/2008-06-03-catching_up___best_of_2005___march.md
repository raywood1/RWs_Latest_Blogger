<span style="font-weight: bold;">Martha Stewart Living Free </span>

By CHUCK COLSON

EARLY Friday morning, one of America's most celebrated prison inmates, Martha Stewart, walked through the doors of the Federal Prison Camp in Alderson, W. Va., to the great delight of her fans. Her release has people asking a pertinent question: What, precisely, are prisons for?

When I arrived at the Maxwell Federal Prison in Montgomery, Ala., in the summer of 1974 in the wake of Watergate, I was greeted by a burly caseworker who seemed undaunted that he was processing the former special counsel to the president. "Just remember one thing, Colson," he said. "The reason you are here is to be punished."

Not a particularly warm welcome, but sound theologically. Any system of justice requires punishment, which prison certainly is. It's painfully dehumanizing to be stripped and searched, assigned a number, and handed six pairs of used underwear and brown dungarees, as I was.

That prison is punishment is the first lesson. Eventually, every inmate hears the correctional officer's favorite sonnet: "You did the crime, now do your time." Prison is cold.

The second lesson inmates learn is how to do the time. During my first two weeks I was administered a battery of tests, after which the guards assigned me to the prison laundry.

For me, doing time wasn't so bad because I also enjoyed reading and soon discovered that I could counsel needy inmates. But most inmates "did time" by trying to sleep it away. In the dormitory at any hour of the day or night I'd find half the inmates stretched out, sleeping 18 hours a day. Life in prison corrodes the soul.

The third lesson is that there is vocational training for the fortunate few, but for most, the only "training" is learning how to avoid getting caught the next time. At Maxwell, evening conversations in the TV room sounded like seminars on improving professional criminal qualifications. It's not surprising that 67 percent of inmates are arrested or incarcerated again within two years.

SEVERE EARTHQUAKE IN INDONESIA HAS NO EFFECT ON SCHIAVO CASE
Networks Explain Decision to Stay in Florida

A severe earthquake measuring 8.7 on the Richter scale which struck Indonesia on Tuesday had "little or no effect" on the Terri Schiavo case, the 24-hour news networks confirmed today.

The networks made the announcement to explain why they had for the most part retained their massive media presence outside Ms. Schiavo's hospice in Florida while offering scant coverage of the Indonesian disaster, which has so far resulted in a death toll topping 1,000.

"While the Indonesian earthquake appears to be a disaster of unspeakable magnitude, it is difficult to see it having any lasting impact on the Schiavo story," one network source said. "The public trusts us to deliver Schiavo news on a 24-hour-a-day basis and we do not intend to betray that trust."</p>
