<div class="post-body">
<p>The Employment and Disability Institute (EDI) within the ILR School at Cornell University has now rolled out its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190906053748/http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/edi/DisabilityStatistics/">Disability Status Reports</a> on the American Community Survey (ACS) data for 2008.  These reports are available in PDF format for each state and also for the U.S. a whole.  Based on a review of a few such reports, it appears that each is a 65-page document covering the same list of topics, as presented in each report's list of contents.  (Note that the contents list items are clickable; for example, clicking on the line for "Prevalence:  All Ages" takes you immediately to page 10 of the report.)  Those topics are presented under two main headings, as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="text-decoration: underline;">Demographics</span></b><br/>
Prevalence: All Ages<br/>
Prevalence: Ages 4 and under<br/>
Prevalence: Ages 5 to 15<br/>
Prevalence: Ages 16 to 20<br/>
Prevalence: Ages 21 to 64 (Working-Age)<br/>
Prevalence: Ages 65 to 74<br/>
Prevalence: Ages 75 and Older<br/>
Prevalence: Gender and Age<br/>
Prevalence: Hispanic / Latino Origin and Age<br/>
Prevalence: Race<br/>
<br/>
<b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="text-decoration: underline;">Outcomes</span></b><br/>

For example, the Employment section appears on pp. 32-33, apparently using virtually identical text and identically formatted graphs in each report, so that the first bulleted point on page 32 reads as follows in, say, the Michigan report.  I offer editorial comments on these reports in a contemporaneous post.<br/>
<blockquote>In 2008, the employment rate of working-age people with disabilities in MI was 33.6 percent.</blockquote>whereas the Indiana report differs only by ending that first bulleted point with the words “in IN was 39.8 percent.”  In short, the reports provide a state-by-state, plain-English summary of key points that one will hopefully soon be able to obtain directly from the Census Bureau’s American FactFinder <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190906053748/http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ACSSAFFPeople?_event=&amp;geo_id=01000US&amp;_geoContext=01000US&amp;_street=&amp;_county=&amp;_cityTown=&amp;_state=&amp;_zip=&amp;_lang=en&amp;_sse=on&amp;ActiveGeoDiv=&amp;_useEV=&amp;pctxt=fph&amp;pgsl=010&amp;_submenuId=people_4&amp;ds_name=null&amp;_ci_nbr=null&amp;qr_name=null&amp;reg=null%3Anull&amp;_keyword=&amp;_industry=">webpage for disability statistics</a>.  (Note that EDI’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190906053748/http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/edi/DisabilityStatistics/">Disability Statistics webpage</a> also links to disability data from the decennial Census and the Current Population Survey (CPS).</p>
