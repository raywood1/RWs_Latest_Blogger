"New Gallup poll of Iraqi citizens came out yesterday — says two- thirds of them want us out of Iraq. Let me explain something to you people. We *invaded* you. We're not your in-laws freeloading during spring break. I imagine the Germans wanted us out of their country too after WW II. We'll let you know when we're ready to get out of there, OK? ... By the way, when are we getting out of there already?" —Jimmy Kimmel

Legalization
________

Starting in the fall, pharmacies in British Columbia will sell marijuana for medicinal purposes ....

[Marijuana] is a powerful, mind-altering drug. ... But it is remarkably nontoxic. In more than 5,000 years of recorded use, there is no verified case of anybody dying of an overdose. Indeed, no fatal dose has ever been established.

Over the past two decades billions of dollars have been spent fighting the war on marijuana, millions of Americans have been arrested and tens of thousands have been imprisoned. Has it been worth it? According to the government's National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, in
1982 [when Ronald Reagan began the War on Drugs,] about
54 percent of Americans between the ages of 18 and 25 had smoked marijuana. In 2002 the proportion was ... about
54 percent. ...

In 1972 a commission appointed by President Richard Nixon concluded that marijuana should be decriminalized in the United States. ...

Just because your voice reaches halfway around the world doesn't mean you are wiser than when it reached only to the end of the bar. -- Edward R. Murrow

A few months ago, I was having a conversation with one of our Christian fundamentalist friends. She was (and may still be) convinced that God put George Bush into the presidency. The problem with her viewpoint, I tried to explain, was that this makes God responsible when things do not turn out well. It is, essentially, blasphemy; it is the worst way to use God's name in vain.

Water

Preliminary research indicates that 8-10 glasses of water a day could significantly ease back and joint pain for up to 80% of sufferers.

Having Children
A note from a friend
____________

I think there are just too many freakin people on the face of the Earth. ... I expect the USA to look like India before the end of this century. Too many people, hungry, no decent shelter, no land left for grazing or even grain production. Polluted water, polluted air. Raw sewage in the streets. ...

I paid my very first property taxes this year. I was stunned to see how much I am paying to help pay for other people's kids. The school taxes are killing me, especially since I could not afford to have kids of my own. I specifically chose not to have kids because I could not afford to give them a decent upbringing, yet I have to pay for everyone else's kids? ... I don't think a person who is childless should pay for other people's kids. And if I do, how come I can't discipline the unruly brats in public? ...

I am happy to not have contributed to the exponentially increasing, out of control, population explosion. Besides, who would possibly want me for their Mother? Unborn children everywhere thank me.

Deficits
_____

[In 1992, after the Reagan and Bush administrations], the federal deficit was more than $300 billion — about 5 percent of the economy. President Bill Clinton and Congressional Democrats reversed this profligate trend by slashing spending and raising taxes. The strategy was hard to swallow, and not at all popular — not a single Republican member of Congress voted for Mr. Clinton's 1993 budget. Some of us in the president's cabinet thought he had gone further than he needed to; there was too little money left for education, job training and health care. But there is no disputing that the plan had the intended effect. Deficits that had ballooned under Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush were brought firmly under control. Bond traders breathed great sighs of relief. Wall Street beamed.

The PayPhone Project
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190906053848/http://www.payphone-project.com/">http://www.payphone-project.com/</a>

It started as an art project. Blue spiral notebook in hand, Mark Thomas spent afternoons walking the streets of Manhattan, compiling the numbers and locations of public pay phones. He posted them on his Web site in the hope that people would call them.

"There is real beauty in whimsical acts of contact between strangers," he explained. Soon his list expanded to include public phones at the top of the Eiffel Tower, in the basement of the Vatican, in the middle of the Mojave Desert, and at about 450,000 other places around the world.

Word of his project spread, and Cindy in Hawaii reported having had the strangest conversation about beaches with a man answering a pay phone in Brazil. Kim from Sydney, Australia, said she called a phone on the corner of 57th and Broadway in Manhattan, where a guy answered, "Wassup" and said he had never heard of Australia. Most surreal of all was the conversation Mr. Thomas had when he picked up a pay phone in Queens, at the 36th Avenue stop of the N line, and the person on the other end explained that he had found the number on Mr. Thomas's Web site.

Jon Stewart's Commencement Address at William &amp; Mary
_________________________________________

Thank you Mr. President, I had forgotten how crushingly dull these ceremonies are. Thank you.

My best to the choir. I have to say, that song never grows old for me. Whenever I hear that song, it reminds me of nothing. ...

I know there were some parents that were concerned about my speech here tonight, and I want to assure you that you will not hear any language that is not common at, say, a dock workers union meeting, or Tourrett's convention, or profanity seminar. Rest assured.

I am honored to be here and to receive this honorary doctorate. When I think back to the people that have been in this position before me from Benjamin Franklin to Queen Noor of Jordan, I can't help but wonder what has happened to this place. Seriously, it saddens me. As a person, I am honored to get it; as an alumnus, I have to say I believe we can do better. And I believe we should. But it has always been a dream of mine to receive a doctorate and to know that today, without putting in any effort, I will. It's incredibly gratifying. Thank you. That's very nice of you, I appreciate it. ...

But today isn't about how my presence here devalues this fine institution. It is about you, the graduates. I'm honored to be here to congratulate you today. Today is the day you enter into the real world, and I should give you a few pointers on what it is. It's actually not that different from the environment here. The biggest difference is you will now be paying for things, and the real world is not surrounded by three-foot brick wall. And the real world is not a restoration. If you see people in the real world making bricks out of straw and water, those people are not colonial re-enactors—they are poor. Help them. And in the real world, there is not as much candle lighting. I don't really know what it is about this campus and candle lighting, but I wish it would stop. We only have so much wax, people.

Let's talk about the real world for a moment. We had been discussing it earlier, and I ... I wanted to bring this up to you earlier about the real world, and this is I guess as good a time as any. I don't really know to put this, so I'll be blunt. We broke it. ...

I don't know if you've been following the news lately, but it just kinda got away from us. Somewhere between the gold rush of easy internet profits and an arrogant sense of endless empire, we heard kind of a pinging noise, and uh, then the damn thing just died on us. So I apologize. ...

But obviously that's the world. What about your lives? What piece of wisdom can I impart to you about my journey that will somehow ease your transition from college back to your parents' basement?

I know some of you are nostalgic today and filled with excitement and perhaps uncertainty at what the future holds. I know six of you are trying to figure out how to make a bong out of your caps. I believe you are members of Psi U. Hey that did work, thank you for the reference. ...

So how do you know what is the right path to choose to get the result that you desire? And the honest answer is this. You won't. And accepting that greatly eases the anxiety of your life experience. ...</p>
