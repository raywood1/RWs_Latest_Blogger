title: "Other Virtualization Solutions to Play Audio in Ubuntu 9.04"

<div class="post-body">
<p>I was running 64-bit Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty Jackalope).  I wanted to use IrfanView to listen to .wav files.  I had been using it in a VMware Workstation 6.5.2 virtual machine (VM) running Windows XP, but I had lately been having a problem with stuttering audio playback, and my efforts to fix it had failed so far.  It was possible that I had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190906053728/http://raywoodcockslatest.blogspot.com/2009/07/ubuntu-904-vmware-workstation-652.html">not correctly applied</a> all of the suggestions I had encountered, so one option was to go back and review the recommended steps, perhaps by spending a few weeks working through the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190906053728/http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-766683.html">Comprehensive Video &amp; Multimedia Howto</a>.  Since there seemed to be users whose problems persisted after trying those suggestions, however, I thought perhaps I should try out some alternatives.  I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190906053728/http://communities.vmware.com/message/1323687#1323687">posted a question</a> about the VMware problem and left it at that for the time being, reserving the option of trying the supposedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190906053728/http://swik.net/Ubuntu/OnlyUbuntu+Tutorials/Howto+setup+Pulseadio+and+VMWare+with+2+soundcards/csf9s">surefire solution</a> of installing a second sound card.<div>
</div><div>One alternative was to try running IrfanView directly on Ubuntu, with the assistance of Wine.  I had made some progress on that, but that, too, was still pending resolution of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190906053728/http://raywoodcockslatest.blogspot.com/2009/07/installing-and-using-irfanview-for.html">a posted question</a>.  Another possibility I had overlooked was to use VMware Player instead of VMware Workstation.  Player (a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190906053728/http://www.vmware.com/products/player/">free download</a>) had been installed when I had installed Workstation, and was now available to me in Ubuntu at System Tools &gt; VMware Player.  I opened a VM that I had powered down (i.e., that was not merely suspended) in Workstation.  I hadn't really used Player before.  I was pleased to see that it seemed to run VMs a little faster and simpler than Workstation.  </div><div>
</div><div>I tried playing audio in VMware Player.  To my surprise, both IrfanView and Windows Media Player played .wav audio files just fine, with no stuttering!  I had shut down the machine the previous evening and powered it back up again that morning, so I wondered whether the cold restart had made a difference.  I started up Workstation, resumed a previously paused VM, and tried playing .wav files in there.  Those, too, played fine.  Apparently the restart had indeed temporarily fixed the problem - might, indeed, have been the reason why the other solutions I had tried had seemed to work.  I had rebooted the system previously, but it now seemed that I simply hadn't left it turned off long enough.</div><div>
</div><div>Since the problem seemed to be fixed, I abandoned (at least for the time being) the other possibilities that I had begun to explore.  In case I (or someone else) needed them, however, that list of possibilities included the following:</div><div><ul><li>Perhaps I could successfully run IrfanView inside a virtual appliance.  These would seemingly be subject to the same VMware Workstation problems, but perhaps not, somehow.  I searched <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190906053728/http://www.vmware.com/appliances/">the VMware Virtual Appliances webpage</a> for IrfanView but, not surprisingly, found nothing.  My <a href="//web.archive.org/web/20190906053728/https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;rlz=1B3GGGL_enUS318US318&amp;num=50&amp;newwindow=1&amp;q=site:http://www.vmware.com/appliances/directory/+%22windows+xp%22&amp;aq=f&amp;oq&amp;aqi">Google Search</a> for WinXP applications in the VMware catalog didn't seem to turn up anything special, but <a href="//web.archive.org/web/20190906053728/https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;rlz=1B3GGGL_enUS318US318&amp;num=50&amp;newwindow=1&amp;q=site:http://www.vmware.com/appliances/directory/+%22windows+7%22&amp;aq=f&amp;oq&amp;aqi">a search for "Windows 7"</a> indicated that, for $10, I could download something called the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190906053728/http://www.vmware.com/appliances/directory/146943">Bagvapp RC Windows 7 beta</a>.  They said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190906053728/http://bagside.com/bagvapp/">this thing</a> also came with additional software installed.  (Microsoft provided <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190906053728/http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/get/download.aspx">additional information</a> on this free (possibly bug-filled) Release Candidate.)  For ten bucks, of course, it made huge good sense to just buy the pre-installed VM from Bagvapp; but since I didn't really need it, I contented myself with signing up for <a href="//web.archive.org/web/20190906053728/https://www.google.com/ig/add?feedurl=http://bagside.com/bagvapp/bagrss.xml">Bagvapp's RSS feed</a>.  (Most of their stuff was free, but they said they were swamped with orders for the RC and had to pay for a ton of bandwidth.)  There also seemed to be other free Windows 7 beta virtual appliances, such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190906053728/http://www.vmware.com/appliances/directory/238993">one from Tuxdistro</a>, although not all appeared to be as fully tricked-out as the one from Bagvapp.  The Win7 RC, in any case, was said to be valid for another eight months, until March 2010.</li><li>In March 2009, Jonathan DiPrizio discussed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190906053728/http://www.techthrob.com/2009/03/02/virtualization-in-linux-a-review-of-four-software-choices/">four virtualization options</a> in Linux.  Those four were Qemu, Parallels, VMware, and VirtualBox.  DiPrizio found VMware and VirtualBox to be the clear winners among these four, and actually preferred the latter.  So I would have the option of trying to run IrfanView in VirtualBox, if the VMware problems continued.</li><li>I had also located Wikipedia articles on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190906053728/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_virtualization">application virtualization</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190906053728/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_virtualization">platform virtualization</a>.  These led to consideration of other possibilities, such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190906053728/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Virtual_PC">Microsoft Virtual PC</a> and DosBox.</li></ul></div></p>
