<p><p>You can replace the old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180904032937/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,4149,27023,00.asp" mce_href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,4149,27023,00.asp">MultiRen</a> utility, provided by PC Magazine in 1998 (when they were giving readers good freeware utilities) with a feature in the freeware program <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180904032937/http://www.explorerxp.com/" mce_href="http://www.explorerxp.com/">ExplorerXP</a>. In ExplorerXP, you highlight multiple files and choose Commands &gt; Rename (or just F2). You then choose a mass renaming function (e.g., Trim) and play with it. It doesn't make the changes right away -- it just shows you what it is going to do. It is a significant improvement over MultiRen, never mind the mass-renaming feature <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180904032937/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/320167" mce_href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/320167">provided in Windows XP</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180904032937/http://netez.com/2xExplorer/" mce_href="http://netez.com/2xExplorer/">2xExplorer</a> provides a dual-pane interface that appears similar to the dual-pane interface in the old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180904032937/http://www.google.com/search?q=%22powerdesk+98%22&amp;sourceid=navclient-ff&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rlz=1B3GGIC_enUS230US230" mce_href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22powerdesk+98%22&amp;sourceid=navclient-ff&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rlz=1B3GGIC_enUS230US230">PowerDesk 98 Utilities</a>. The program's filtering tool, icons, and other features also appear to provide a welcome resurrection of some PowerDesk capabilities, in a form that works in WinXP.</p></p>
