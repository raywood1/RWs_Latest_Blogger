<div class="post-body">
<p>Problem:  I want to keep up with what they are saying at a hundred different websites:  New York Times, craigslist ads for Dogs for Sale, UM SSW blog, etc.  But I can't keep checking all these sites every hour.  What can I do?

Solution:  RSS.

Many websites now let you "subscribe" to their RSS "feeds."  (This is all free, by the way.)  A feed keeps feeding the stuff to you, as soon as it is posted.  So, for example, you can have a <a href="//web.archive.org/web/20190906053731/https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=facebook+rss&amp;sourceid=navclient-ff&amp;rlz=1B3GGGL_enUS318US318&amp;ie=UTF-8">Facebook feed</a> that lets you know when something has happened on Facebook, without actually having to go to the Facebook webpage.

In other words, you can get up-to-the-minute articles from a hundred webpages, all delivered to one RSS feed webpage.

You read your feeds in an RSS reader.  I use <a href="//web.archive.org/web/20190906053731/https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=google+reader&amp;sourceid=navclient-ff&amp;rlz=1B3GGGL_enUS318US318&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">Google Reader</a>.  So instead of having to keep all those websites open, I just keep that one Google Reader webpage open.  It shows me what's happening in the feeds that I have subscribed to.  If I want to see the details, with two clicks I can open the full webpage where the item was posted.  But even if time is short, at least I can scan the headlines and, if I wish, the summaries.

To add another subscription, just add another RSS feed.  To find RSS feeds, search webpages or websites for "RSS" or for "feeds."  Example:  at the bottom center of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190906053731/http://nytimes.com/" target="_blank">New York Times</a> homepage, you'll see a little orange RSS button.  Click on that, and you're taken to a page that lists <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190906053731/http://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/index.html" target="_blank">dozens of distinct NY Times feeds</a>.  For instance, they have an Opinions feed (or, if you like, you can subscribe to individual columnists), as well as feeds for Health, International, etc.

Examples of a few other feeds and feed webpages:

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190906053731/http://umsswtx.ning.com/activity/log/list?fmt=rss"><null>Mental </null><null>Health </null><null>&amp; </null><null>Addiction </null><null>Treatment</null></a>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190906053731/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/help/rss/3223484.stm">BBC</a>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190906053731/http://www.addthis.com/feed.php?pub=annarbor&amp;h1=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.annarbor.com%2Frss.xml&amp;t1="><null>Ann </null><null>Arbor </null><null>News</null></a>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190906053731/http://mblog.lib.umich.edu/SSW/index.rdf"><null>UM </null><null>SSW</null></a>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190906053731/http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/action/showFeed?ui=0&amp;mi=3bpn8a&amp;ai=ta&amp;jc=ssr&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss"><null>Social </null><null>Service </null><null>Review</null></a>

You'll develop your own list, adding and dropping feeds, as you learn what's available and observe what you tend to find interesting.

So what about that craigslist ad for a dog?  Craigslist Ann Arbor does have a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190906053731/http://annarbor.craigslist.org/pet/">Pets community,</a> and - like most craigslist pages - that one does have an RSS feed (in the upper right-hand corner).

But maybe you don't want to see a thousand ads for the wrong kind of dog; you want to see only the ads for a five-year-old borzoi.  Is that possible?  Yes, with an <a href="//web.archive.org/web/20190906053731/https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;rlz=1B3GGGL_enUS318US318&amp;num=50&amp;newwindow=1&amp;q=rss+filter&amp;aq=f&amp;oq&amp;aqi">RSS filter</a>.  But that's a story for another day.</p>
