<div class="post-body">
<p>We got out of the Great Depression, in good measure, by gearing up for World War II.  Declaring war against Iraq in 2008 might have made economic good sense.  Now that the money is already spent, someone will have to think of a new way to revive the economy if, as appears increasingly possible, we again wind up in a financial trench.  Or perhaps we will discover a different sense of what a good economy is all about.</p>
