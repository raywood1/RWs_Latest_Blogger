<div class="post-body">
<p>I was on my bike on a street at the University of Missouri.  A pedestrian stopped and asked me if I would consider wearing a bike helmet.  I said I had thought about it, but I found them uncomfortable.  She said it was possible to have an accident and experience brain damage from which you might never recover.  She said it had happened to her.

I went home and thought about it, and I decided it made sense to wear a helmet.  It helped that so many other bicyclists did so.  This seemed to be one of those geeky things that the smart people did, regardless of whether it was geeky.  So I started wearing a helmet whenever I biked.

Since then, my head has hit the pavement on three different occasions.  And I am fine.

So thank you, brain-damage lady.  You may have saved my life.</p>
