<div class="post-body">
<p><p>I started college in 1973, as a pre-ministerial student in a conservative branch of Lutheranism, at Concordia Lutheran Junior College in Ann Arbor, MI. I took a lot of extra courses and basically didn't have another full year's worth of schoolwork to do for my Associate's degree, which was all Concordia offered at that time; so in 1974 I transferred to Indiana University. There, I experienced a crisis of faith, because my continuing biblical studies exposed me to the reality that people at a state university often talk about the New Testament in terms that were very different from those with which I was familiar. I was not certain whether I could and should continue in a ministerial line of study, so I dropped out of I.U. and moved to Los Angeles, where I spent several years living with or near my brother and sister, both of whom had moved out there from Indiana within the past few years. The following year, I began taking courses at California State University, Long Beach. There, I continued the study of classical Greek, which I had begun at Concordia and had continued at Indiana, and I also gained more of an understanding of ancient Greek philosophers.</p> <p>In those classics studies, and also in my subsequent political science study at Columbia College in New York, I got the impression that Plato and Aristotle had formed a lot of the basic ideas, and had posed many of the root questions, that have been intriguing thinkers ever since. I had dreams of becoming thoroughly educated in the classics, beginning with Plato.</p> <p>Unfortunately, my legal education and practice took me far away from that earlier, learning-oriented mindset. For a number of years, my hope of becoming at least somewhat knowledgeable about the classics was on hold, while I pursued the much more day-to-day life of a lawyer and a New Yorker. While living in Maine in 1996, however, I took several weeks and devoted myself to the task of writing a restatement, as I called it -- a paraphrasing, if you prefer -- of Plato's <i>Republic</i>.</p> <p>That was undeniably a learning experience. I became familiar with the text to a much greater extent than had been possible in the rushed reading we gave it in my undergraduate classics (or was it political theory?) course at Columbia College. I felt that I had also provided a real service, insofar as my restatement made <i>The Republic</i> much easier to understand than most translations did. A translator was required to stick with the words of the Greek text; I had the freedom to take another sentence or two, when necessary, to clarify a concept. I was not working from the Greek, and it seemed to me that I did not need to. I was not seeking scholarly precision; I was just trying to communicate the basic ideas to new readers of the classic work.</p> <p>Publishers were generally not interested in the resulting manuscript. One was, but the editor had his own ideas about what Plato was trying to say. Part of me said that I should do it his way and get a publication out of it, but I think the better part of me said that it made more sense to just post it online for free. My experience with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180904030842/http://raywoodcockslatest.blogspot.com/2007/10/my-publications-take-bar-and-beat-me.html" mce_href="http://raywoodcock.wordpress.com/2007/10/11/autobiography-take-the-bar-and-beat-me/" target="_blank" title="Take the Bar and Beat Me"><i>Take the Bar</i></a> had taught me that it could take twice as long to edit and publish a book as it took to write it. I was under no illusions about making money or gaining fame from a restatement of <i>The Republic</i>.  Mostly, I just wanted to learn, and to share what I had learned.</p> <p>I sent out some e-mails to promote the book to people (mostly professors) with an evident interest in <i>The Republic</i>.   Some of them took note.  For a while, there were a number of sites with links that pointed to my <i>Republic </i>webpage.  There are now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180904030842/http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;newwindow=1&amp;rlz=1B3GGGL_enUS242US242&amp;q=plato+republic+%22ray+woodcock%22&amp;btnG=Search" mce_href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;newwindow=1&amp;rlz=1B3GGGL_enUS242US242&amp;q=plato+republic+%22ray+woodcock%22&amp;btnG=Search" target="_blank" title="Google Search for Woodcock's Republic">only a few left</a>. No doubt that would change if I promoted it again. But where a book of this sort needs to be promoted is not to college professors, who I think will generally want their students to read highly accurate (and sometimes hard-to-understand) translations. This is more for students, and I don't presently know of websites (other than something on the Cliff's Notes level) that try to connect students with in-between materials of this type. They're surely out there, but I don't have time to search for them now.</p> <p>Anyway, my original <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180904030842/http://www.geocities.com/raywoodcock/oth-onln.htm" mce_href="http://www.geocities.com/raywoodcock/oth-onln.htm" target="_blank" title="People's Republic of Plato"><i>People's Republic of Plato</i></a> webpage is still there. The site includes a slightly cleaned-up version of the well-known Jowett translation, in which I discovered some a few problems, and to which I added cross-references and other minor improvements. Please feel free to refer it to college students or others who are interested in a fresh, relatively simple interpretation of what Plato was trying to say.</p></p>
