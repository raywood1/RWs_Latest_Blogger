title: "WinXP:  You Must Be Logged in as an Administrator When Installing This Program"

<div class="post-body">
<p>In a new Windows XP installation, I ran into a situation where my system was running really slowly.  To fix that, I tried to install a program called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141107185346/http://download.cnet.com/Advanced-WindowsCare-Personal/3000-2086_4-10783002.html">Advanced Windows Care (AWC)</a>.  That program had been superseded by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141107185346/http://www.iobit.com/advancedwindowscareper.html">Advanced SystemCare</a>, but for some reason (price or performance, I dimly recalled, but I wasn't sure which), I had decided not to take the upgrade.  I was trying to install AWC as part of a new Windows XP installation.  When I tried to install it, I got an error message:<br/>
<blockquote>You must be logged in as an administrator when installing this program.</blockquote>But I was!  I went into Start &gt; Run &gt; control userpasswords2 and observed that my username, Ray Woodcock, was a member of the Administrators group, just like the Administrator itself.  But according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141107185346/http://www.speedguide.net/read_articles.php?id=158">Philip's SpeedGuide</a>, writing on another issue, being in the Administrators group was not the same as being an (or should I say The) Administrator.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't have the option of logging in as Administrator.  When I booted up, my startup screen showed only the Ray Woodcock username.  To add the Administrator on that opening page, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141107185346/http://www.astahost.com/info.php/add-administrator-account-logon-screen_t15002.html">Astrahost advised</a> a registry edit at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\SpecialAccounts\UserList to add a DWORD named Administrator with a value of 1, followed by a restart.  That worked -- I did have an Administrator account to log into now -- but I still got the same error message.  I checked -- I was definitely <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141107185346/http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/setup/tips/advanced/adminaccount.mspx">logged in as Administrator</a> -- but Advanced Windows Care didn't think so.  <br/>
<br/>
I verified that this was not just an AWC issue.  I tried installing another basic utility, known as Bulk Rename Utility, and got the same message:  "You must be logged in as an administrator when installing this program."<br/>
<br/>
I got a clue from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141107185346/http://help.wugnet.com/windows2/Administrator-allowed-change-local-security-settings-ftopict519979.html">Marcin</a>, who said this:<br/>
<blockquote>If the [computer] is a member of a domain, then settings applied via Active Directory GPOs will take effect even when [it] is not connected to the network. Is this the case? If so, you would need to make the computer account a member of a workgroup (i.e. remove it from the domain) in order to be able to modify the local password policy.</blockquote>Pursuing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141107185346/http://www.google.com/search?q=xp+administrator+domain+workgroup&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a">a search</a> along these lines, I heard <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141107185346/http://www.askdavetaylor.com/resetting_domain_on_windows_xp.html">Dave</a> suggest that I try Control Panel &gt; System &gt; Computer Name &gt; Change &gt; Member of Workgroup.  But that was already how it was set.  While switching between accounts, though, I noticed that the slowness existed only in the Ray Woodcock account, not in the Administrator account.  So I went into the Administrator account, hit Start &gt; Run &gt; control userpasswords2, selected the Ray Woodcock account, and clicked Remove &gt; OK.  The dialog closed.  I went back into it and the Ray Woodcock account was still there.  I did it again.  This time, I got a message saying, "Ray Woodcock will no longer be allowed to use this computer."  Taking that as proof that computers are not yet smart enough to control the world, I clicked Yes.  That didn't solve the problem of not being able to install AWC, but it did solve the problem of having a slow Ray Woodcock account.  I decided to just use the Administrator account for now.  It was still somewhat slow, but at least it was functional.<br/>
<br/>
To install a program that requires the installer to be logged in as Administrator, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141107185346/http://www.vistax64.com/vista-account-administration/155010-you-must-logged.html#post719119">Richard Harper</a> suggested (for Vista) that you right-click on the program to be installed and click "Run as Administrator."  There was no option in XP, and anyway, I was already running as administrator.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141107185346/http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7programs/thread/b9dc99f4-b876-428e-b50b-b1f7c6dfed56">Carpetfresh</a> indicated that the problem also arose in Windows 7, and the suggestions offered in that case seemed to have been things that s/he had already tried.  After reviewing some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141107185346/http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/software-os/f/3524/t/19324221.aspx">other discussions</a> that did not seem to be drawing much attention or producing clear solutions, I decided to take the advice of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141107185346/http://www.msfn.org/board/topic/135388-installing-updates-on-hp-computer-gives-you-must-be-logged-in-as/">Buckdog05</a>:  it was unsettling to have a new Windows installation be already showing difficult problems, so I decided to start over.<br/>
<br/>
I tried a repair installation (insert the Windows installation CD, proceed toward installation, but then choose repair rather than a fresh installation).  This seemed to make little practical difference, though; the system went through a more or less complete new installation process, complete with the requirement of entering the Product ID during installation and then of activating the installation.  But then I saw that Comodo Fireway and Avast antivirus were still installed, so plainly it was different from a new installation in some ways.  Unfortunately, the repair installation did not fix the "You must be logged in as an administrator" error -- even though there was now only one Administrator account, and that's what I was logged in as.  So I tried again, this time doing a complete reinstallation from scratch (i.e., not a repair installation).<br/>
<br/>
After doing the complete reinstallation, including (this time) a decision to delete the Ray Woodcock account and make sure that everything was being installed in the Administrator account, I tried again to install AWC.  This time it installed with no problems.</p>

**Rough**:
If the above fixes dont work, you can always check my computer and make sure your drive is C: as a lot of programs and updates will default to this location, and if it does not exist, will cause these type of issues as well.
