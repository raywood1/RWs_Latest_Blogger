<div class="post-body">
<p>Another installment in the continuing effort to distill the best postings from my personal mailing list.  There were a lot of things that still seemed worthwhile, so I decided to take it one month at a time.  So now I am up to whatever I posted there in April 2004.

Pets trigger our 'feel good' hormones, research suggests
By Jane Weaver
Updated: 9:45 a.m. ET April 02, 2004

Those big brown eyes gazing at you with complete adoration. The cool, wet nose nudging bare feet in the early morning. That tireless wagging tail that symbolizes pure joy in your presence.

We know that dogs are dedicated companions that offer unquestioning attachment and acceptance. In the past several years, mounting scientific evidence suggests that they benefit us even beyond eager devotion. Numerous studies have shown that dogs -- one of the earliest domesticated animals -- can help lower blood pressure, ease the loneliness of the elderly in nursing homes, and help children overcome allergies.

Now there's new research from the University of Missouri-Columbia suggesting the hormonal changes that occur when humans and dogs interact could help people cope with depression and certain stress- related disorders. Preliminary results from a study show that a few minutes of stroking our pet dog prompts a release of a number of "feel good" hormones in humans, including serotonin, prolactin and oxytocin.

In addition, petting our pooches results in decreased levels of the primary stress hormone cortisol, the adrenal chemical responsible for regulating appetite and cravings for carbohydrates. ...

MARRIAGE SEMINAR

While attending a Marriage Seminar dealing with communication, Tom
and his wife Grace listened to the instructor, "It is essential that
husbands and wives know the things that are important to each
other." He addressed the men, "Can you describe your wife's favorite
flower?" Tom leaned over, touched his wife's arm gently and
whispered, "It's Pillsbury, isn't it?" The rest of the story gets
rather ugly so I'll stop right here.

As one sensible woman put it in her autobiography: "For me, abortion
is a personal issue — between the mother, father and doctor." She
added, "Abortion is not a presidential matter."
President Bush, listen to your mother.

The Mercury Scandal
By PAUL KRUGMAN
Published: April 6, 2004

If you want a single example that captures why so many people no
longer believe in the good intentions of the Bush administration,
look at the case of mercury pollution.

Mercury can damage the nervous system, especially in fetuses and
infants — which is why the Food and Drug Administration warns
pregnant women and nursing mothers against consuming types of fish,
like albacore tuna, that often contain high mercury levels. ...

During the 1990's, government regulation greatly reduced mercury
emissions from medical and municipal waste incineration, leaving
power plants as the main problem. ...

The head of the E.P.A.'s Office of Air and Radiation, like most key
environmental appointees in the Bush administration, previously made
his living representing polluting industries (which, in case you
haven't guessed, are huge Republican donors). ...

E.P.A. experts normally study regulations before they are issued, but
they were bypassed. According to The Los Angeles Times: "E.P.A.
staffers say they were told not to undertake the normal scientific
and economic studies called for under a standing executive
order. . . . E.P.A. veterans say they cannot recall another instance
where the agency's technical experts were cut out of developing a
major regulatory proposal." ...

The murderous attack on four American civilians in Falluja,
Iraq ... introduced Americans to a company few had heard of:
Blackwater USA, which was providing security for food
delivery convoys when its employees were ambushed. ...

[T]here is far less accountability to the American public
and to international law than if real troops were
performing the tasks. In the 1990's, several employees of
one company, DynCorp, were implicated in a sex-trafficking
scandal in Bosnia involving girls as young as 12. Had these
men been soldiers, they would have faced court-martial
proceedings. As private workers, they were simply put on
the next plane back to America. ...

Borowitz Report

Breaking News
BUSH MISSED BILLBOARD OF OSAMA
60-Foot-Tall Sign Appeared Outside White House

The Bush administration today grappled with allegations that
President George W. Bush did not see a sixty-foot-tall billboard
featuring Osama bin Laden that appeared suddenly across the street
from the White House in August 2001.

The gigantic billboard, which featured bin Laden's stern visage and
the words "I AM GOING TO HIJACK U.S. AIRPLANES VERY SOON," was first
spotted by a UPS driver, Clayton Spedding, while making his morning
deliveries on Pennsylvania Avenue.

"I was like, `Didn't there use to be a Bacardi ad up there?'" Mr.
Spedding, 34, told reporters today.

After making his startling discovery, Mr. Spedding called the White
House, but was told to call back when he had "something more
specific."

As Mr. Bush's apparent failure to notice the bin Laden billboard
ignited a new round of finger-pointing in Washington, the President
went on the offensive, warning the al-Qaeda kingpin to make future
terror threats more explicit or "face the consequences." ...

Almost two-thirds of America's corporations paid no federal income
taxes during the late 1990's, when corporate profits were soaring.
Nine out of 10 companies paid less than the equivalent of 5 percent
of their total income. ... Meanwhile, as David Cay Johnston reported
in yesterday's Times, .... [o]ver the last decade, the audit rate for
the largest corporations has fallen by almost half. ... Corporate
taxes now account for about 7.5 percent of overall federal tax
receipts, down from a high of 40 percent during World War II.

More than half the nation's population lives in or around areas that
violate clean air standards, according to a list to be released on
April 15 by the federal government. ... Rural communities will be
affected along with at least seven national parks, including the
Great Smoky Mountains in North Carolina and Tennessee, Acadia in
Maine and Yosemite in California.

I'm told that these stories come from an ex-IRS employee:

Caller: I want to know if I should file married or single.

IRS: Are you married?

Caller: Well, sort of ...

IRS: What?

Caller: Well, we did get married, but we're not counting
on it.

*

Caller: I got a letter from you guys and I want to know
what you want.

IRS: What does it say?

Caller: Just a minute, I'll open it.

*

Caller: I'm a bookkeeper and I need to know if ten $100
bills make a thousand dollars or only ten hundred dollars.

IRS: Both. It's the same amount.

Caller: So why do I get a different answer every time I
move the decimal point?

*

Caller: What does the law say about people who are renting
to relatives and taking a loss on the property?

IRS: You are required to charge them fair market value.

Caller: It's very fair. If we rented to someone else we
could get a lot more.

Caller: Could you please send me some of those WD-40's?

The Washington Post's Style Invitational once again asked readers to

or changing one letter, and supply a new definition. Here are this
year's (2003) winners:

bright ideas from penetrating. The bozone layer, unfortunately, shows
little sign of breaking down in the near future.

Intaxication: Euphoria at getting a tax refund, which lasts until you
realize it was your money to start with.

Reintarnation: Coming back to life as a hillbilly.

Cashtration (n.): The act of buying a house, which renders the
subject financially impotent for an indefinite period.

Giraffiti: Vandalism spray painted very, very high.

Sarchasm: The gulf between the author of sarcastic wit and the person
who doesn't get it.

Osteopornosis: A degenerate disease. (This one got extra credit.)

Dopeler effect: The tendency of stupid ideas to seem smarter when
they come at you rapidly.

Arachnoleptic fit (n.): The frantic dance performed just after you've
accidentally walked through a spider web.

Beelzebug (n.): Satan in the form of a mosquito that gets into your
bedroom at three in the morning and cannot be cast out.

Caterpallor (n.): The color you turn after finding half a grub in the
fruit you're eating.

And the pick of the literature:

Ignoranus: A person who's both stupid and a butthole.</p>
