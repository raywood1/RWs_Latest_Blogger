<p>This is a continuation of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190906053838/http://raywoodcockslatest.blogspot.com/2008/06/importing-autocorrect-entries-from.html">an earlier post on the same topic</a>.

I belatedly discovered that the DAT file that was updated, when I entered a replacement term manually into OpenOffice (OO) Writer, was not at the location I had thought.  Its actual location was C:\Documents and Settings\Ray\Application Data\OpenOffice.org2\user\autocorr.  But copying the updated DAT file there did not make AutoCorrect work either.

At this point, I ran out of time for the investigation.  Hopefully I, or someone else, will eventually find a relatively straightforward way to get AutoCorrect entries from Word to OO Writer without manually re-entering them.</p>
