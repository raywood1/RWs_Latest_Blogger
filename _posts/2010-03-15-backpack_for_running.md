### Comments
**raywood**:
I bought the Deuter Speed Lite 20 and kept it two years.  I was hoping to work up to the point of running from one camping spot to the next, but never got around to it.  So I used it only for local runs, probably a dozen times altogether.  It was really a good, comfortable, capable backpack.  It kept snug to my back -- no sloshing from side to side, even on the one or two occasions when I tied larger items to it.  I could breathe comfortably with the straps snugged down.  It wasn't huge, but it was probably about as large as I would want.  I would love to have more opportunities to get out and really use it.  If and when my schedule allows that to happen, I'll buy another of the same model.
