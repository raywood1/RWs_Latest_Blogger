<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419072427/http://raywoodcockslatest.blogspot.com/2010/05/upgrading-to-ubuntu-1004-lts.html">I had upgraded</a> from Ubuntu 9.10 to Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid Lynx).  Now I wanted to make some adjustments.  For this purpose, I would be drawing upon the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419072427/http://raywoodcockslatest.blogspot.com/2010/03/ubuntu-910-downgrading-from-64-bit-to.html">first</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419072427/http://raywoodcockslatest.blogspot.com/2010/05/installing-32-bit-ubuntu-910-additional.html">second</a> lists of adjustments I had made when I had installed 9.10.<br/>
<br/>
The first of those other things was to install a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419072427/http://raywoodcockslatest.blogspot.com/2010/05/enabling-pae-on-ubuntu-1004.html">PAE-enabled 10.04 kernel</a>, so that I would have access to all of my system's RAM.  I also found that VMware Workstation 7.0 was requiring me to enter my serial number.  I had not entered it after installing it on 9.10; I had just been using the trial serial number.  Now, unfortunately, Workstation was not cooperating:  it was saying "Unknown error entering serial number."  The solution to this problem was to run Workstation as root (i.e., type "sudo vmware" at the Terminal prompt) and enter the serial number there.<br/>
<br/>
Since I was doing an upgrade of a previous installation, I did not have to reinstall packages, but I did have a problem with Software Sources.  I have described that one in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419072427/http://raywoodcockslatest.blogspot.com/2010/05/ubuntu-1004-adjustments-software-source.html">a separate post</a>.  (Even if I had needed to reinstall packages, the "installed-software" trick described in the lists of adjustments (above) would have made short work of it.)  On my laptop, I was doing the same upgrade, and there I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419072427/http://raywoodcockslatest.blogspot.com/2010/07/interrupted-upgrade-from-ubuntu-910-to.html">made some problems for myself </a>when I had to interrupt the upgrade.  Here on the desktop, the next task was (as described in separate posts) to try to get the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419072427/http://raywoodcockslatest.blogspot.com/2010/05/installing-brother-mfc-7340-printer-in.html">printing</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419072427/http://raywoodcockslatest.blogspot.com/2010/05/scanning-functionality-for-brother-mfc.html">scanning</a> features of my Brother MFC-7340 printer working from within Ubuntu.  After doing that, I tackled a problem that I had wanted to solve for years:  how to import the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419072427/http://raywoodcockslatest.blogspot.com/2010/05/importing-microsoft-word-autocorrect.html">list of AutoCorrect entries</a> that I had created in Microsoft Word into OpenOffice.org Writer, running on Ubuntu.  That took some time, but then I was able to get back to the project of working through those notes from previous installations.<br/>
<br/>
The upgrade from Ubuntu 9.10 to 10.04 had preserved much of the configuration I had already set up.  So as I worked through the Ubuntu tweaking steps described in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419072427/http://raywoodcockslatest.blogspot.com/2010/03/ubuntu-910-downgrading-from-64-bit-to.html">one of my previous posts</a>, I had to deal with only a fraction of the issues addressed there.  One was to prevent icons for mounted drives from appearing on the desktop.  That called for Terminal:  “gconf-editor” &gt; /apps/nautilus/desktop &gt; unclick volumes_visible.  But it was already unclicked, and yet I did have icons for mounted drives visible on the desktop.  I went into Applications &gt; System Tools &gt; Ubuntu Tweak &gt; Desktop Icon Settings and clicked Show desktop icons and left everything else unchecked, but this made no difference.  I tried again, this time using “sudo gconf-editor.”  Ah, yes.  The volumes_visible box was checked for root.  Unchecking it removed the icons from the desktop.<br/>
<br/>
I had not noticed, but somewhere along the line, I had evidently installed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419072427/http://packages.ubuntu.com/dapper/gnome/nautilus-open-terminal">nautilus-open-terminal</a> via Synaptic, or possibly it came installed by default.  As its name suggested, this tool added a right-click (context menu) option in Nautilus, "Open in Terminal."  Unlike Windows Explorer, this option was only available for folders in the file listing in Nautilus -- in the right pane, that is, not in the left pane that would typically show the folder tree.  In that left pane, this and other options were absent.<br/>
<br/>
Had another little problem.  During the upgrade to 10.04, the Firefox icon changed, on the left-side (formerly top) panel, to a red <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419072427/http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1310093">do-not-enter</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419072427/http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=9260801">not-allowed</a> kind of icon; and in Applications &gt; Internet, it changed to a grey question-mark box.  I fixed this by going to the panel, right-clicking on Applications &gt; Edit Menus &gt; Internet &gt; Firefox &gt; Properties, clicking on the icon, and selecting /usr/share/pixmaps/firefox.png.  Speaking of Firefox, I wanted Ubuntu to open Firefox and Google Chrome on startup.  I wanted to add these to a script that would <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419072427/http://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;newwindow=1&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rlz=1R1GGGL_en___US333&amp;q=%22startup+script%22+folder+OR+directory+ubuntu+10.04+OR+lucid+-%22windows+7%22+-mac+-compiz+-facebook&amp;btnG=Search">run at startup</a>, since I suspected that I would be coming up with other things that I wanted to have happen at startup too.  It <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419072427/http://embraceubuntu.com/2005/09/07/adding-a-startup-script-to-be-run-at-bootup/">seemed pretty technical</a> – beyond my current ability, anyway – but it looked like I might be able to just write a script and put it into /etc./init.d.  I typed “sudo gedit” and then created a file called /etc./init.d/a_startup_script.sh.  I put, into it, the line that I got from e.g., right-clicking on Applications and choosing Edit Menus &gt; Applications &gt; Internet &gt; Firefox &gt; Properties:  “firefox %u.”  I saved it and typed “chmod +x /etc./init.d/a_startup_script.sh.”  Then I rebooted.  This achieved nothing.  So creating a general-purpose startup script remained a goal for the future.<br/>
<br/>
I also went down <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419072427/http://www.techsupportalert.com/content/ubuntu-tips-and-tricks.htm">Gizmo’s Freeware list of tweaks</a>.  I had already done most of the ones I wanted, but there were a few others.  One was to install Windows TrueType fonts in Ubuntu.  I decided to extend their advice somewhat.  I took a look at System &gt; Preferences &gt; Appearance &gt; Fonts.  I could see that a lot of Windows fonts were not present on the list there.  So in Windows XP, I went to C:\Windows\Fonts.  I selected and copied everything to another, temporary folder called UbuFonts.  In UbuFonts, I sorted by file type and deleted the ones that were not TTF files.  Back in Ubuntu, I typed “sudo nautilus” and went to /usr/share/fonts/truetype.  It already had a folder called msttcorefonts, but with only a fraction of the fonts that I had just copied from C:\Windows\Fonts to UbuFonts, and the font files there seemed older and smaller.  I made a backup copy of the msttcorefonts folder and then copied everything from UbuFonts into /usr/share/fonts/truetype/msttcorefonts.  Now System &gt; Preferences &gt; Appearance &gt; Fonts had a much wider selection.  I changed the fonts to Tahoma 10 and the monospace to Courier 10.  Tahoma allowed me to see more information on each line onscreen.<br/>
<br/>
Another tweak from Gizmo called for some playing around with Compiz.  This was a bad idea, as described in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419072427/http://raywoodcockslatest.blogspot.com/2010/05/compiz-in-ubuntu-1004-same-as-it-ever.html">a separate post</a>.  Another tweak of interest was to clean up the GRUB boot menu.  I typed “uname -r” and saw that I was using the 2.6.32-22-generic-pae kernel.  In Synaptic, I searched for linux-image, clicked at the top of the left-hand column to sort by those that were installed, and marked for removal all numbered items other than that kernel.  In this case, that included just two items:  linux-image-2.6.31-21-generic-pae and linux-image-2.6.32-22.generic (i.e., not pae).  I did another search for linux-headers and marked all non-2.6.32-22-generic-pae items there too.  In this case, trying to remove linux-headers-2.6.32-22 threatened to remove linux-headers-2.6.32-22-generic-pae as well; but I wanted to keep that, so I didn’t remove linux-headers-2.6.32-22.  On restart, I saw that GRUB now listed just the 2.6.32-22-generic-pae kernel and its recovery mode, along with memtest and Windows XP (it was a dual-boot machine).  I went back into Ubuntu without a problem.  I did later have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419072427/http://raywoodcockslatest.blogspot.com/2010/05/resuming-vmware-virtual-machine-could.html">a VMware problem</a> that might have been related to this, though.<br/>
<br/>
Gizmo also pointed me toward a number of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419072427/http://www.techsupportalert.com/content/best-free-software-linux.htm">recommended freeware apps</a>.  These were for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419072427/http://www.google.com/search?q=kde+gnome&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rlz=1R1GGGL_en___US333">KDE (not GNOME) desktop</a>.  I thought it might be time to try KDE, if only to check out these programs.  One was the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419072427/http://www.kabatology.com/09/09/wally-rotates-desktop-backgrounds-in-linux-windows-and-macosx/">Wally</a> wallpaper changer, which I installed through Synaptic.  Getting Wally (and the whole KDE desktop) involved a total of 91 files.  Other interesting pieces of Gizmo-recommended software I got through Synaptic:  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419072427/http://recordmydesktop.sourceforge.net/rug/toc.php">gtk-recordMyDesktop</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419072427/http://dolphin.kde.org/">Dolphin</a> file manager.  Downloaded directly from creators’ websites, I got <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419072427/http://www.debugmode.com/wink/">Wink</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419072427/http://sourceforge.net/projects/freefilesync/files/">FreeFile Sync</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419072427/http://partedmagic.com/">Parted Magic</a>.  I did consider using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419072427/https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> as well, because of its good reviews (by e.g., <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419072427/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2343861,00.asp">PC Magazine</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419072427/http://www.onlinebackuptools.com/dropbox-review/32">Online Backup Tools</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419072427/http://www.laptopmag.com/review/software/dropbox.aspx">Laptop</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419072427/http://alternativeto.net/desktop/dropbox/">alternativeTo</a>; but I decided that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419072427/https://sync.live.com/clientdownload.aspx?ibm=10">Windows Live Sync</a> had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419072427/http://radiologygeek.wordpress.com/2010/02/13/windows-live-syncmicrosofts-answer-to-drop-box/">important advantages</a> even though I would have to run it in a virtual machine when I was booted into Ubuntu.<br/>
<br/>
(Note:  a few days later -- possibly the first time I tried it after installing KDE -- Google Desktop search was no longer responding to its default Ctrl-Ctrl hotkey.  That is, its Quick Search Box was not coming up.  Something I saw on some webpage, as I was trying to fix that problem, made me wonder whether the KDE installation was to blame.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419072427/http://superuser.com/questions/137528/ubuntu-10-04-has-broken-google-desktop-ctrl-ctrl-search-bar-feature">A tip</a> that fixed it was to open the Google Desktop Search preferences and change the hotkey to Ctrl-F1.)<br/>
<br/>
The last thing to do, in this round of tweaking, was to clean out unnecessary stuff from the drive on which I had installed Ubuntu, so that I could make a backup image in case I needed to reinstall – so that I could just restore the image, that is, instead of having to go back through all these steps.  This, I thought, called for something like the TreeSize utility that I had used in Windows to see where I might have files or folders taking up huge amounts of space.  Among what seemed to be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419072427/http://www.google.com/search?q=treesize+linux&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rlz=1R1GGGL_en___US333">several possibilities</a>, I found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419072427/http://sourceforge.net/projects/treesize/">an actual Linux version</a> of TreeSize, so I downloaded that – but I also discovered Ubuntu’s Applications &gt; Accessories &gt; Disk Usage Analyzer, whose Treemap Chart was especially interesting.  These revealed that my Ubuntu installation was not presently very large, so I didn’t have to worry too much about shrinking it for this particular image.  It also revealed that by far the largest space hog, within that installation, was the Google Desktop index of stuff on my hard drive, at 5.2GB.  I did see that the Google Chrome cache was also taking 400MB.  I went into Chrome’s Settings (the wrench icon at the upper-right corner) &gt; Options but didn’t see any way to control that, other than to just clear the cache.  I decided to leave it for now, and changed some other settings while I was there.  And that was it.  Ubuntu 10.04 was tweaked, at least for now.</p>
