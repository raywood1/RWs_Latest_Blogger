<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190906053705/http://www.x-setup.net/">Tex and Eric</a>, the <a href="//web.archive.org/web/20190906053705/https://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;newwindow=1&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=De1&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;q=WUG+bankruptcy+OR+insolvency+%22X-Setup+Pro%22&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi&amp;aql&amp;oq&amp;gs_rfai">bankruptcy of WUG</a> has ended that organization's sponsorship of X-Setup Pro, a Windows tweaking utility.  Their message ends as follows:<br/>

In case you lost your serial number use this one instead: <b>XSA092-11TA9R-8K12YT</b></blockquote>I had used this program years earlier.  I now installed and tried to run it in a Windows XP virtual machine (VM) in VMware Workstation 7.1 on an Ubuntu 10.04 host.  When I clicked on the "Classic" button, it immediately presented me with this error message:<br/>
<blockquote>C:\Program Files\X-Setup Pro\bin\xqdcXSPUI.exe (/START): Access is denied. (Win32 Error Code 5)</blockquote><a href="//web.archive.org/web/20190906053705/https://www.google.com/search?q=C:%5CProgram+Files%5CX-Setup+Pro%5Cbin%5CxqdcXSPUI.exe+(/START):+Access+is+denied.+(Win32+Error+Code+5)&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a">A search</a> for precisely that error turned up nothing.  In <a href="//web.archive.org/web/20190906053705/https://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;newwindow=1&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=qCM&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;q=%22Access+is+denied%22+%22win32+error+code+5%22+-printer&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi&amp;aql&amp;oq&amp;gs_rfai">a modified search</a>, I saw <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190906053705/http://www.ks-soft.net/cgi-bin/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=4030&amp;start=0&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;highlight=&amp;sid=47f5f75227276421ee9f84fd80171f51">an indication</a> that "Access is denied" and "Win32 Error Code 5" mean the same thing.  Before researching that further with <a href="//web.archive.org/web/20190906053705/https://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;newwindow=1&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;q=%22Access+is+denied%22+OR+%22win32+error+code+5%22+%22X-Setup+Pro%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi&amp;aql&amp;oq&amp;gs_rfai">a refined search</a>, it occurred to me to see whether it would happen again.  This time, clicking on Classic raised a Comodo Defense+ (firewall) dialog asking me if it was OK to proceed.  Allowing that, and another two or three after it, solved the problem:  the X-Setup windows opened.<br/>
<br/>
I wondered whether X-Setup superseded Tweak UI.  Laptop (magazine?) rated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190906053705/http://archive.laptopmag.com/Review/X-Setup-Pro-8.ht">X-Setup</a> more highly than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190906053705/http://archive.laptopmag.com/Review/TweakUI.ht">Tweak UI</a>; but they observed that novices can get lost in X-Setup and may find Tweak UI more suitable for their needs.  My recollection, circa 2001, was that I had hosed my system with X-Setup once or twice.  I decided to use both for a while.  Following the tip from Tex and Eric, and consistent with  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190906053705/http://raywoodcockslatest.blogspot.com/2010/07/portableapps-in-windows-xp.html">a current effort</a> to make Windows XP perform better in VMware Workstation, I decided to try using the portable versions of <a href="//web.archive.org/web/20190906053705/https://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;newwindow=1&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=GtN&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;q=%22X-Setup+Pro%22+portable&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi&amp;aql&amp;oq&amp;gs_rfai">X-Setup</a> and <a href="//web.archive.org/web/20190906053705/https://www.google.com/search?q=%22tweak+ui%22+OR+tweakui+portable&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a">Tweak UI</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The most interesting feature of X-Setup, for me, was its Record function.  This feature made it possible to create distinct .reg files for each registry tweak.  So I could pick and choose the registry edits I wanted to use this time, and could run their "undo" counterparts if I didn't like the effects.<br/>
<br/>
The explanations of various options in X-Setup were surprisingly  articulate and lucid.  Those explanations did not conceal some degree of  confusion in the structure of X-Setup tweaks, however.  There was redundancy;  there were instances when I thought I had changed something and then  came across something that looked very similar but yet had not been  changed.<br/>
<br/>
While there was no denying that X-Setup had a large number of tweaks, I found that they did not cover some registry edits I would have liked to see.  The authors readily acknowledged, as well, that some of the tweaks performed by some X-Setup plug-ins would not be captured in .reg files.  I found, in addition, that many of the tweaks I generated from within X-Setup were already set out on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190906053705/http://www.kellys-korner-xp.com/xp_tweaks.htm">Kellys-Korner</a> and <a href="//web.archive.org/web/20190906053705/https://www.google.com/search?q=xp+tweaks+registry&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a">Elder Geek</a> websites, among <a href="//web.archive.org/web/20190906053705/https://www.google.com/search?q=xp+tweaks+registry&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a">others</a>.<br/>
<br/>
After running X-Setup and making system adjustments, I found that the new  Windows XP installation I had used it on was performing very slowly -- even  though I had made sure not to make any changes that X-Setup had flagged  as potentially dangerous.  Ultimately, this slowness and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190906053705/http://raywoodcockslatest.blogspot.com/2010/07/winxp-you-must-be-logged-in-as.html">other problems</a> led me to wipe my new Windows installation and start over.  I was not sure whether X-Setup was directly to blame for such problems, but I did make sure, the second time around, to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190906053705/http://raywoodcockslatest.blogspot.com/2010/08/tweaking-windows-xp-backups-proceeding.html">proceed with caution</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Despite those caveats, X-Setup Pro did generate a number of useful scripts for me, and when used with suitable caution, it provided very helpful ways of improving my Windows XP installation.</p>
