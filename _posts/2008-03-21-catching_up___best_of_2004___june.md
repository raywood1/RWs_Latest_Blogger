<p>Another installment in the continuing effort to distill the best postings from my personal mailing list. There were a lot of things that still seemed worthwhile, so I decided to take it one month at a time. So now I am up to whatever I posted there in June 2004.

"A fiery Al Gore called for the resignation of Donald Rumsfeld, Condoleeza Rice, and CIA Director George Tenet. Bush was furious. He said to Gore, 'Hey, who elected you president?!'" —Jay Leno
"President Bush is going to establish elections there in Iraq. He's going to rebuild the infrastructure. He's going to create jobs. He said if it works there, he'll try it here." —David Letterman

"Attorney General John Ashcroft told Congress they shouldn't be asking him about the legality of the war until the war is over. And there's precedent for that — I think it's called the Nuremberg Trials." —Jay Leno

"President Bush met with the Pope in Rome. Did you see the picture of the two of them? Man, that poor guy, he has a blank look on his face like he doesn't know where he is. Then, the Pope told him, just be quiet and relax." —David Letterman

"Former President Bush, to celebrate his 80th birthday, jumped out of an airplane. And if you've seen the polls, you know he's not the only Bush in freefall." —David Letterman

"According to the New York Times, last year White House lawyers concluded that President Bush could legally order interrogators to torture and even kill people in the interest of national security — so if that's legal, what the hell are we charging Saddam Hussein with?" —Jay Leno

I hate hoax warnings, but this one is important! Send this warning to everyone on your e-mail list!

If someone comes to your front door saying they are conducting a survey &amp; asks you to take your clothes off, do not do it!

This is a scam; they only want to see you naked.

I wish I'd gotten this yesterday. I feel so stupid and cheap now ...

May 27, 2004 — Food additives are associated with symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), according to the results of a randomized trial published in the June issue of the Archives of Diseases in Childhood.

"Almost every patient who is seen either in a family practice clinic or in specialty clinics does have something wrong with their sleep, and that if you address sleep problems, improvements can be made." Another interesting quote: "40% of respondents with insomnia had one or more psychiatric disorders vs. 16% of those with no sleep complaints."

CALAIS, France (Reuters) -- Entrepreneur Richard Branson has set a new world record by driving across the English Channel in an amphibious sports car in under two hours. ... As the car drove up on to Calais' sandy beach, its windscreen wiper still going, a very wet but elated Richard Branson emerged. "A few big ferry waves engulfed us a bit, but it was rather refreshing," Branson said. "Its a remarkable car and it definitely gets a lot of smiles from people on the ferries."

SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Go-go boys and drag queens waved rainbow- colored flags as hundreds of thousands of dancing revelers clogged a downtown avenue to celebrate gay pride on Sunday. Organizers said they expected 1.5 million people to attend the Eighth Annual Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Trans-gender Pride Parade, which would make it the world's biggest gay event.

It is widely recommended that patients with back pain need to be encouraged to resume normal activities as soon as possible.

There are two major types of behavioral anxiety-induction techniques; flooding and implosion. ... Implosion is ... anxiety-filled .... For example, in implosive sessions, snake-phobic clients have been told to imagine the following sequence: see the snake; pick up the snake; it is biting you; let it bite; feel the pain; it is crawling into your eye sockets and wiggling in there; now feel it wiggling inside your head. This technique is not used as frequently as it once was. [From Walborn, "Process Variables," pp. 149-150.]

Mr. Ashcroft is very close to the gun lobby .... After 9/11, he ordered that all government lists — including voter registration, immigration and driver's license lists — be checked for links to terrorists. All government lists, that is, except one: he specifically prohibited the F.B.I. from examining background checks on gun purchasers.

"I don't know that Atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God." -President George Bush

The David Letterman Scholarship was established by David Letterman in 1985 to provide scholarships for telecommunications students at Ball State University. The awards are intended for average students who nevertheless have a creative mind. Winners are selected primarily based on creativity. Projects may involve a variety of media, including written work, research, audio, video, graphics and film. The winner receives a $10,000 scholarship. The first runner-up receives $5,000. The second runner-up receives $3,333.

Highly educated people may call themselves independents, but when it comes to voting they tend to pick a partisan side and stick with it. College-educated voters are more likely than high-school-educated voters to vote for candidates from the same party again and again. ... Once you've joined a side, the information age makes it easier for you to surround yourself with people like yourself. And if there is one thing we have learned over the past generation, it's that we are really into self-validation.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">White House Report</span>

President George W. Bush's increasingly erratic behavior and wide mood swings has the halls of the West Wing buzzing lately as aides privately express growing concern over their leader's state of mind. ...

Worried White House aides paint a portrait of a man on the edge, increasingly wary of those who disagree with him and paranoid of a public that no longer trusts his policies in Iraq or at home. ...

In interviews with a number of White House staffers who were willing to talk off the record, a picture of an administration under siege has emerged, led by a man who declares his decisions to be "God's will" and then tells aides to "fuck over" anyone they consider to be an opponent of the administration. ...

Aides who raise questions quickly find themselves shut out of access to the President or other top advisors. Among top officials, Bush's inner circle is shrinking. Secretary of State Colin Powell has fallen out of favor because of his growing doubts about the administration's war against Iraq. ...

God may also be the reason Attorney General John Ashcroft, the administration's lightning rod because of his questionable actions that critics argue threatens freedoms granted by the Constitution, remains part of the power elite. West Wing staffers call Bush and Ashcroft "the Blues Brothers" because "they're on a mission from God."

"The Attorney General is tight with the President because of religion," says one aide. "They both believe any action is justifiable in the name of God."

But the President who says he rules at the behest of God can also tongue-lash those he perceives as disloyal, calling them "fucking assholes" in front of other staff, berating one cabinet official in front of others and labeling anyone who disagrees with him "unpatriotic" or "anti-American." ...

The White House did not respond to requests for comment on the record.

[Note:  President Bush won re-election five months after this article was published.]

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Senior Leaders Call for End of Bush Presidency </span>

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Bush administration's foreign policy in Iraq and elsewhere has been a "disaster," and President Bush should not be re-elected, a group of former diplomats and military leaders say in a newly released statement. ...

A statement from the group notes its more than two dozen members include Democrats and Republicans who have "served every president since Harry S. Truman."

They contend Bush's foreign policy has failed at "preserving national security and providing world leadership."

Members expressing their opposition in the statement are former senior diplomatic, national security and military officials.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Laughter for Healing </span>

Studies have shown that patient satisfaction correlates with the length of visits and the emotional tone of medical encounters. When patients think that they have connected with the physician, they are more satisfied with their care and are more likely to follow the doctor's advice. Gross et al found that patients feel less rushed if physicians spend even a brief time chatting with them. ...

A recent study examined patient-physician communication as it relates to malpractice risks. Primary care physicians with no history of malpractice claims differed from those who had experienced claims in three areas - physicians with no claims history spent more time with patients, used facilitative statements more often, and relied on laughter and humor more often during their encounters than did physicians who had been sued for malpractice. ...

The term gallows humor describes a type of morbid humor that people use in the face of tragedy or death. ... A recent study found that experienced paramedics do not share their work-related humor with family and friends for fear that it will not be understood. Consequently, it is important that patients be shielded from this type of medical humor so that they do not misinterpret the laughter as cruel or uncaring. ...

Naftulin et al found that "student" ratings could be influenced by a teacher's style. In their study, an actor was enlisted to lecture to a group of mental health professionals. The actor was coached to use humor to make the presentation enjoyable, even though the lecture included double-talk and contradictory statements. The participants rated the speaker highly despite the lack of substance in the presentation. ...

Ziv studied the effects of humor during a 14-week statistics course for college students. The subject matter and teacher for both the control and experimental groups were identical, except that the teacher included the use of humor in the experimental group. At the end of the course, on the final examination, the students who were exposed to humor performed significantly better than the group with which humor was not used. Ziv emphasized that humor works best in small doses-usually four or five jokes or cartoons per lecture-and that the humor should be relevant to the material taught.

Of all the blunders American military leaders have made in Iraq, one of the least talked about is how they succeeded in arming the insurgents.

By the time of the coalition invasion, Iraq had one of the largest conventional arms stockpiles in the world. ...

The marines I was embedded with — a forward reconnaissance unit at the front of the initial invasion — were stunned by the sheer amounts of weaponry they saw as we raced across some 400 miles to Baghdad. Along much of the route, Iraqi forces had dug holes every couple of hundred yards in which they'd piled grenades, mortars and other munitions. ...

But under orders to reach Baghdad as quickly as possible, the marines rarely had a chance to remove, destroy or even mark the stockpiles. In one village, combat engineers (led by local children whom they had bribed with bags of Skittles candies) discovered an underground bunker crammed with dozens of sophisticated air-to-ground missiles. Yet higher-ups in the division insisted that there was no time to destroy them. The marines moved on, leaving the missiles unguarded.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Are You an Agent of Terror? </span>

Stanley Milgram's experiments on obedience to authority--sometimes referred to as the "shock" studies--are the most influential and controversial in modern social psychology. ...

Milgram recruited a diverse group of psychologically normal adult men to participate in a laboratory experiment supposedly designed to measure the effects of punishment on learning. Each subject was given the role of teacher and instructed to ask another ostensible subject
(actually a research assistant who was a confederate of the experimenter) a series of questions. The subject in the role of teacher was instructed to administer an electric shock each time the "learner" made an error, beginning with a mild 15 volts and progressing in 15-volt intervals up to an eventual 450 volts, which was clearly marked as extremely dangerous. Although no shocks were actually administered, the situation was orchestrated to appear terrifyingly realistic. Midway through the experiment, the confederate, who was in an adjoining room where he could be heard but not seen, screamed out that he was having a heart attack; eventually, he ceased responding altogether. If the subject resisted administering shocks, the experimenter urged him on with statements like "It is absolutely essential that you continue" and "You have no choice. You must go on."

How many psychologically normal people would administer a 450-volt shock to someone who might be going into cardiac arrest as a result? When Milgram posed this question to others, the average estimate was no more than one in a hundred people. A group of psychiatrists guessed one in a thousand. ...

Astonishingly, however, Milgram found that a full 65 percent of the men (26 out of 40) went to 450 volts. ...

In a television interview in 1979, Milgram said that he eventually came to the conclusion that "If a system of death camps were set up in the United States of the sort we had seen in Nazi Germany, one would be able to find sufficient personnel [to operate] those camps in any medium-sized American town."

The obedience studies indelibly changed our understanding of the Holocaust. In early explanations of the brutalities, Nazi leaders were demonized as pathological sadists and monsters. Hannah Arendt challenged this in her book "Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil," which depicted Adolf Eichmann as a conventional bureaucrat trying to further his career. Milgram, having seen ordinary people submit to authority in his experiments, concluded that Arendt's perspective "comes closer to the truth than one might dare imagine." He argued that "the most fundamental lesson" of his findings was that "ordinary people, simply doing their jobs, and without any particular hostility on their part, can become agents in a terrible destructive process."

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Abortion Realities </span>

Fetal genetic tests are now routinely used to diagnose diseases as well known as cystic fibrosis and as obscure as fragile X, a form of mental retardation. ...

Most couples say they are both profoundly grateful for the new information and hugely burdened by the choices it forces them to make. The availability of tests earlier in pregnancy mean that if they opt for an abortion it can be safer and less public. ...

"But nobody's talking about it. Certainly not here in southeastern Virginia," where anti-abortion groups are so vocal. ...

"People will come into my office in tears and say they've been against abortion their whole lives," [Dr. John Larsen, chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at George Washington University Medical Center] said, "but they'll make an exception for themselves." ...

KERRY-GEPHARDT MEETING CREATES OMINOUS BLACK HOLE IN UNIVERSE

Could Devour Earth, Scientists Fear

A meeting between presumptive Democratic nominee John Kerry and possible running mate Rep. Richard Gephardt (D-MO) has created a mysterious black hole in the universe that could eventually swallow Earth and all of its inhabitants, scientists said today.

Dr. Carlton Hong, an astrophysicist at the University of Minnesota, said that shortly after the two top Democrats sat down to talk, "pools of extremely low energy began to form" creating "what can only be described as a creepy, black-hole-like vacuum."

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Quotes on the Great Depression from Studs Terkel's Book </span>

"Black and white, it didn't make any difference who you were, 'cause everybody was poor. All friendly, sleep in a jungle [i.e., a hobo camp]. ... Twenty-five or thirty would be out on the side of the rail, white and colored. They didn't have no mothers or sisters, they didn't have no home, they were dirty, they had overalls on, they didn't have no food, they didn't have anything."

"I saw a railroad police, a white police. They call him Texas Slim. He shoots you off all trains. We come out of Lima, Ohio . . . Lima Slim, he would kill you if he catch you on any train."

"The shame I was feeling. I walked out [of my home] because I didn't have a job. I said, "I'm goin' out in the world and get me a job." And God help me, I couldn't get anything. I wouldn't let them see me dirty and ragged and I hadn't shaved. ... I'd write, "Dear Mother, I'm doin' wonderful and wish you're all fine." That was in Los Angeles and I was sleeping under some steps and there was some paper over me."

"I was with a bunch of hoboes, drinkin' canned heat. I wouldn't eat two or three days, 'cause I was too sick to eat."

"The poor people had it rough. The rich people was livin' off the poor."

[Terkel asks: Did you find any kindness during the Depression?] "No kindness. Except for Callahan the hobo -- only reason I'm alive is 'cause Callahan helped me on that train. And the hobo jungle. Everybody else was evil to each other. There was no friendships. Everybody else was worried and sad looking. It was pitiful."

"When tramps and hoboes would come to their door for food, the southern white people would drive them away. But if a Negro come, they will feed him."

"They would hire Negroes for these type jobs where they wouldn't hire whites. They wouldn't hire a white woman to do housework, because they were afraid she'd take her husband."

"The Negro woman who worked for the white woman would take food and wrap it in newspapers. Sometimes we would hurry down the alley and holler at 'im: "Hey, mister, come here!" ... Negroes would always feed these tramps."

"The majority of people were hit and hit hard. They were mentally disturbed you're bound to know, 'cause they didn't know when the end of all this was comin'. There was a lot of suicides that I know of."

"A lot of times one family would have some food. They would divide. And everyone would share."

"It's different today. People are made to feel ashamed now if they don't have anything. Back then, I'm not sure how the rich felt. I think the rich were as contemptuous of the poor then as they are now. But among the people that I knew, we all had an understanding that it wasn't our fault."

"That's one of the things about the Depression. There was more camaraderie than there is now. Even more comradeship than the Commies could even dream about. That was one of the feelings that America lost. People had different ideas, they disagreed with one another. But there was a fine feeling among them. You were in trouble . . . damn it, if they could help ya, they would help ya."</p>
