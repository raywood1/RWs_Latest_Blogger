title: "Another Cynical Bush Foreign Entanglement?"

<div class="post-body">
<p>In December 1992, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190906053840/http://avuncularamerican.typepad.com/blog/2007/12/bush-to-clinton.html">after he had lost the election to Bill Clinton</a>, the  internationally knowledgeable outgoing president George H. W. Bush sent U.S. troops to Somalia.  In effect, he saddled Clinton with a foreign entanglement that he had known would likely be a failure and a mess.  It was a cynical political move, done at the expense of American lives and prestige.

So now I see reports that his son, George W. Bush, is contemplating an attack on Iran shortly before he leaves office.  Would anyone care to bet that the odds of such an attack rise if a Democrat wins the White House in November?</p>
