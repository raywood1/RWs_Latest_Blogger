title: "Thunderbird:  Upgrading While Keeping Incompatible Extensions"

<div class="post-body">
<p>I was using Thunderbird 3.1.16.  I wanted to upgrade to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190906052618/http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/" target="_blank">the current version</a>, which was Thunderbird 8.0.  In 3.1.16, I was using two add-ons that, I feared, would not be compatible with 8.0.  Those two extensions were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190906052618/http://raywoodcockslatest.blogspot.com/2010/08/exporting-from-thunderbird-importing.html" target="_blank">ImportExportTools</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190906052618/http://raywoodcockslatest.blogspot.com/2011/03/thunderbird-for-windows-transition-from.html" target="_blank">Remove Duplicate Messages</a>.  (I also had AttachmentExtractor, but it was apparently nonfunctioning.)  I had found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190906052618/http://kb.mozillazine.org/Keep_it_working_%28Thunderbird%29" target="_blank">a MozillaZine webpage</a> that suggested a way to make extensions work even if they were supposedly incompatible.  So now I decided to see if that advice would work for me.<br/>
<br/>
I started by installing T-bird 8.0.  During the installation process, it asked me if I wanted to keep my add-ons.  I said yes.  When the installation was done, Thunderbird started.  I went into Tools &gt; Add-ons.  This opened the Add-ons Manager.  It displayed all three add-ons as being ready to go.  <br/>
<br/>
I don't recall what happened next.  Apparently I didn't need those extensions for a couple of months.  When I returned to them, I found that they were labeled as incompatible with Thunderbird 8.0.  But when I upgraded to T-bird 10.0, it looked like they were all set to work.  I used Remove Duplicate Messages (Alternate), and it seemed to work.  End of issue, at least for now.</p>
