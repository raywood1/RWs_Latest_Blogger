<div class="post-body">
<p>A little formal, that title, but OK.  I'm starting a blog because I have written tons of stuff that either (a) has never seen the light of day or (b) saw the light of day, briefly, in some obscure website somewhere, and is now barely retrievable -- even though I, personally, might wish I could find it, for myself and/or for others who are asking questions that I asked.  So my purpose for this blog is to have one place, one repository, where I can unload tons of stuff like that.  I'm inexperienced in blogging, but, you know, sometimes you learn by doing.</p>
