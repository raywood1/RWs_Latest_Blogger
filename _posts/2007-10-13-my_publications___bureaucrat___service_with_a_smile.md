<div class="post-body">
<p><p>In the early 1990s, I was employed with a federal agency. It taught me about bureaucracy. I kept copious notes; and after I departed, I processed the experience. I was interested in writing another book vaguely like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180904030812/http://raywoodcockslatest.blogspot.com/2007/10/my-publications-take-bar-and-beat-me.html" mce_href="http://raywoodcock.wordpress.com/2007/10/11/autobiography-take-the-bar-and-beat-me/" target="_blank" title="My blog posting on Take the Bar and Beat Me"><i>Take the Bar</i></a>, but I wanted to talk about a subject that would interest more people. So this time around there would be no footnotes or extensive research; it would be more like a novel, but it would give me (and any interested readers) a chance to work through what, exactly, was happening to us in our working lives.</p> <p>So in the mid-1990s I wrote <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180904030812/http://raywood1.bravehost.com/thebook.htm" mce_href="http://raywood1.bravehost.com/thebook.htm" target="_blank" title="Bureaucrat - the text"><i>Bureaucrat:  Service with a Smile</i></a>. It does accurately reflect what life was like, for those of us who were working in some branches of the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC). The RTC is gone now; it dissolved along with the conclusion of the savings &amp; loan (S&amp;L) crisis and bailout that led to its creation in the late 1980s. I promoted the manuscript to a number of publishers but found no takers. I finally put it on a webpage in 1999 and essentially forgot about it. I was wondering if it was still there, so today I looked and, yeah, it is. I have just re-read a few pages of it, and, you know, I still think it was a fun book.</p></p>
