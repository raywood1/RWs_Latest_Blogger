title: "Google Search:  Freeware:  Get Rid of Unwanted Sites"

<div class="post-body">
<p>I was using Google to search for freeware.  My search produced a bunch of websites that did not give me what I wanted.  This post briefly describes some steps I took to get better search results.<br/>
<br/>
First, I modified my search to eliminate some sites that were giving me a combination of freeware and shareware.  For purposes of this particular search, I figured that any freeware of good quality would have been noticed and commented on by a number of people.  People selling software had a number of strategies to obscure the fact that they were not offering freeware.  Not to blame them -- they worked hard on their software, and they wanted to make some money for it -- but what I was searching for wasn't important enough to buy.  If there was a freeware solution, great; if not, I'd just skip it.  So the modified search I used was this (assuming I was searching for software related to "mouse" and "cursor"):<br/>
<blockquote>mouse cursor freeware -shareware -"free download" -"free trial" -"free to try"</blockquote>This got through one set of unwanted results, but I wasn't done.  Now I was getting a bunch of websites that offered all kinds of freeware, but none providing what I was looking for specifically.  They just seemed to put up any freeware that seemed remotely related, and that wasn't helping me.  I was doing this search in Firefox, and I knew of two ways to get rid of these sorts of sites in Firefox.  (There probably were similar solutions in Google Chrome, but I didn't check.)  One approach was to install the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151205114135/https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wot-safe-browsing-tool/">Web of Trust</a> (WOT) add-on, and look for its colored rings next to the search results.  These, I had found, were helpful but sometimes alarmist.  <br/>
<br/>
Another approach, which I used in conjunction with WOT, was to install the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151205114135/https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/optimizegoogle/">OptimizeGoogle</a> add-on, and start to build up its list of list of filters.  The steps here were, first, to install the add-on, and then, in Firefox, go into Tools &gt; Add-ons &gt; Extensions tab &gt; OptimizeGoogle &gt; Options &gt; Filter.  My list of filters was still growing, but at this point the list was as follows:<br/>
<blockquote>http://*.recipester.org/*<br/>
http://*.neevia.com/*<br/>
http://*.headkeys.com/*<br/>
http://headkeys.com/*<br/>
http://*.all-freeware.com/*<br/>
http://*.softducks.com/*<br/>
http://*.topshareware.com/*<br/>
http://*.top4download.com/*<br/>
http://*.xentrik.com/*<br/>
http://*.fileguru.com/*<br/>
http://*.software.informer.com/*<br/>
http://*.filebuzz.com/*<br/>
http://*.bestfreewaredownload.com/*<br/>
http://*.windows7download.com/*<br/>
http://*.freedownloadscenter.com/*<br/>
http://*.winsite.com/*<br/>
http://*.easyfreeware.com/*<br/>
http://*.brothersoft.com/*<br/>
http://*.filetransit.com/*<br/>
http://*.macshareware.com/*<br/>
http://*.fileheap.com/*<br/>
http://*.informer.com/*<br/>
http://mac.download3000.com/*<br/>
http://*.mac360.com/*<br/>
http://*.freemacware.com/*<br/>
http://www.downv.com/Mac-software-download/*<br/>
http://*.downloadatoz.com/*<br/>
http://*.ptf.com/*</blockquote>I saved that list (Export from the filter list) for when I would have to reinstall Firefox.  With this list in place, Google searches in Firefox that found any of these websites would now give me a small, greyed-out line to let me know that my results were being filtered, but would focus on the remaining sites.  This, I found, reduced distraction and saved time in other searches.</p>

Apparently similar extension for Google Chrome:  Search Engine Blacklist.  See https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/jiicbcimbjppjbckmoknagndlhjbeohbNote:  in the present version, you have to enter each filtered site manually.
